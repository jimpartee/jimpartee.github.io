<p>As the pandemic changed the way we shop for groceries and essentials, many of us turned to delivery apps like Instacart and Uber Eats to get our daily needs delivered straight to our doorstep. These companies had to develop methods for indexing the available products at a wider variety of stores than previously, and in doing so, had to solve some very interesting challenges to the customer experience.</p>

<p>Using the massive increase in revenues, these delivery apps invested millions in the ability to index and merchandise menus to be easily accessible to consumers.  However, a frustrating experience that can still persist is selecting an item on the app only to receive a message that says "Item not found" (INF).</p>

<p>INFs are a source of disappointment for customers, who often do not get what they want or end up with unsatisfactory substitutes. This has prompted delivery apps to find innovative ways to prevent these occurrences and improve their overall service.</p>

<p>One way delivery apps are preventing INFs is by gathering ground truth information in innovative ways. For example, Uber Eats has been paying drivers a small bonus to take pictures of shelves to understand inventory levels and item availability in real time. Additionally, some services have started to pipe in consumer data to provide real-time inventory levels for specific stores. These approaches help align customer expectations about the frequency of INFs and improve overall customer satisfaction.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How Delivery Apps should Manage INFs</h2>

<p>However, even with these innovative methods, INFs can still occur. Delivery apps should employ a three-pronged approach to address this frustrating customer experience because it is inevitable sometimes. First, they ought to make it easy for customers to share their substitution preferences.  They should strive to understand their level of flexibility and intent beyond just a list of SKUs. Most apps allow for a pre-selected group of substitutions to be chosen before or directly after ordering.  But pre-selecting a group of potential substitutes may not fully understand the use case behind why the customer ordered. For example, let's say you order acetaminophen in liquid form from your local bodega, but they only have NyQuil.  If you get substituted for NyQuil, but the purpose behind the order was to acquire medicine for your morning routine, that may not be suitable.</p>

<p>Second, they ought to improve the process for customers and drivers to communicate about solutions when substitutions are needed.  If the customer chooses not to pre-select substitutes or the selected options aren’t available, the shopper and customer need to be able to briefly discuss what the best option is— usually some other item or a refund.  Most apps have solved this by providing in-app messaging.  Many folks have a particular Instacart shopper that they </p>

<p>Third, delivery apps ought to empower drivers to make reasonable decisions that they believe the customer would have made in the store.  When all else fails, it’s important that the final decisions are made with the customer in mind.  Delivery apps measure INFs from different drivers and rank those highly who deliver amazing customer experiences even through difficulty.  Applications such as DoorDash and Instacart use this data to determine which shoppers should receive the most valuable orders.  </p>
