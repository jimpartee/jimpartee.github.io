## Jim's Blog

 - Hey dude, I made this blog for you. High level this blog is completely run by markdown files.
   All you need to do to write new posts is just write a simple markdown file like the one you
   see here! No coding involved.

 - You will need to use git from time to time to post new posts but thats about it!

 - The ``_config.yml`** holds most of the major configurations that you will want to change.

 - All in all, its a pretty shallow learning curve to get started with this type of blog and
   I can help with various peices easily because of, well, git. But honestly ive made this
   so that everything should be straightforward, but if its not thats on me and just let
   me know.

**Love you Jim**
